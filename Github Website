<p> Football or also known as soccer is without a doubt, the most popular sport in the world. 43% of the world population identifies themselves as soccer fans and 250 million
people play the game. This is due to the impressive dribbling, shooting, and many other skills that these players show off that makes it so entertaining. Another fact is that
the game is cheap to play. You onlyneed a round ball and an open space to play. That is why it is called the "people's game". This saying comes from England which is the where
football was invented.</p>

<h2>History of Football</h2>
<p>Football was invented in the year 1863 in England. It was played in various towns near London and in other parts of England. This led to the formation of various teams that 
later competed against each other in the competition known today as the FA Cup that was founded in 1871. With England colonizing many places, football spread to different parts of
Central and South America and then later to continents like Africa. This made the spread of soccer very easy and made it the most popular sport in many parts of the world. Each 
nation created their own team and competed in the first World Cup in 1930. This would later become the most prestigious award in Football.</p>
